# Emojis in Live Text for Sketch

There are some interesting use cases for including Emoji symbols in your Sketch app workflow. These are outlined below. I wanted a quick way to see them all. Therefore I decided to replicate the set in a Sketch file.

## Suggested uses
* To include Emojis as part of your layer, group or symbol name
* To use Emojis as icons / artwork (layers or symbols)
* To include Emojis alongside regular text, when mocking up Messaging apps or other interfaces where you'd want to simulate how people use Emojis in a sentence or paragraph.
* You could also 'Save as Template' for easy access

### No 💩 Sherlock:

I am aware, as you may also be, that another way to get to Emojis in Sketch is to insert text and then key in:

> `Ctrl Cmd Space`

But I still felt like this file would be useful for seeing all at once 🤓.
