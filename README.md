# Emojis in Live Text for Sketch

There are some interesting use cases for including Emoji symbols in your Sketch app workflow. These are outlined below. I got sick of going to a source outside of Sketch to find and copy / paste the emoji that I wanted into Sketch. Therefore I decided to replicate the set in a Sketch file. 

## Suggested uses
* To include Emojis as part of your layer, group or symbol name
* To use Emojis as icons / artwork (layers or symbols)
* To use Emojis when mocking up Messaging apps or other interfaces where you want to simulate their real-world use.
